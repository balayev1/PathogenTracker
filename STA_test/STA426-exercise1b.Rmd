## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Create log-normal distribution

n =100 #sample size
x = rlnorm(n,meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25) #make log-normal distribution
xlog = log(rlnorm(n,meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)) #make log-normal distribution with log scaled probabilities

#Create histogram
hist(x, main="Unscaled log-normal distribution") #for unscaled distribution
print(mean(x))
print(var(x))

hist(xlog, main="Log scaled log-normal distribution") #for log-scaled distribution
print(mean(xlog))
print(var(xlog))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
