## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Data Import
x = readRDS(gzfile("/Users/agshin_balayev/Downloads/counts.rds"))
anno = readRDS(gzfile("/Users/agshin_balayev/Downloads/phenodata.rds"))

## Compute and visualize basic statistics

## Most variable genes

library(pheatmap)

## PCA

# In the exercise session, we saw a potential case where the normal PCA can be misleading.

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
