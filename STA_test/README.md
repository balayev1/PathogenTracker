# Statistical Tests

## There are four types of statistical data: **nominal, ordinal, interval** and **ratio**. Based on the statistical type belonging of the independent and dependent variables, different statistical tests are available. 

### For example: If both variables are nominal/ordinal: use Fischer's exact Test explained in this link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyAvvaMjfM)

### However, if independent variable is interval/ratio type: use Logistic Regression explained in this link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN5cNN2-HWE&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF&index=14&t=379s) The logic behind this method is to fit a logistic curve to the data: ![Logistic regression model](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*UgYbimgPXf6XXxMy2yqRLw.png)

### If we have two groups with interval/ratio data: use **t-test**. ![t-test](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NkGvw18zlGQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

### If more than two groups with interval/ratio data: use **ANOVA** explained in this link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS_BKChyPuc)
